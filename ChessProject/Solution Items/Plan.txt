1. Begin a most basic implementation, ensuring good tests coverage
1a. ChessEngine created, API defined and first implementation is the "basic" variant for use in Console App
1b. At the same time-ish Create a Console App that allows for easy testing/visualisation in C++

2. Set up benchmarking, profiling

3. Iterative Chess Engines to work on performative, investigating trade-offs etc.

4. Work beyond the MVP (integration with C# client, use C-Make etc.)
